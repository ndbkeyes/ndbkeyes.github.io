I'm Nash Keyes (they/them), an early-career professional in climate adaptation and planning. I am passionate about the intersections of urban studies, geography, water, and environmental justice, including community-based adaptation planning, fighting green gentrification, and extreme heat and flood community preparedness. My skills range from GIS, climate science, and research to writing, design, public speaking, and facilitation.

I graduated from Yale University in 2021 with a B.A. in Applied Mathematics focusing on Climate Science. Currently, I am an ORISE Fellow at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Water working on equitable water utility climate adaptation, and I plan to pursue a joint masters in urban planning and geographical & environmental systems next year. Outside of work, I am an avid amateur woodworker and fledgling community organizer.
