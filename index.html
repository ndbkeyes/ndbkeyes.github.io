    <p>I'm Nash Keyes (they/he), a climate scientist & applied mathematician currently based in New Haven, CT. I am working as a postgraduate associate with Dr. John Wettlaufer in the Yale Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences, researching colored noise behavior and stochastic modeling in paleoclimate glacial cycle data from the EPICA ice core. 
    </p>
    <p>
I graduated from Yale University in 2021 with a B.A in Applied Mathematics in the Earth & Planetary Sciences track. During college, I interned in the Earth Sciences division at NASA GSFC and worked on Arctic Ocean data analysis with Dr. Mary-Louise Timmermans (Yale EPS) and Dr. Isabela Le Bras (woods Hole Oceanographic Institution). I was a founding member of the Applied Mathematics DSAC (Departmental Student Advisory Committee); was involved in climate justice activism with the Endowment Justice Coalition & in anti-Zionist organizing with Yale Jews for Palestine; and worked at the LGBTQ Office as a student staffer at and as co-president of Trans@Yale (the undergraduate organization for transgender & nonbinary students).
    </p>
    <p>
In the long term, I hope to do climate science work, either on the mathematical side of complex systems & fluid dynamics, or on the infrastructural side of urban design, climate adaptation, and environmental justice. I also hope to get re-involved in community organizing for queer/trans & racial/economic & climate justice issues, and to eventually release some guitar, cello, and/or electronic music.    
    </p>
    <p>
      In New Haven, I'm currently involved in various community groups in addition to my research job at Yale. I'm a bike maintenance volunteer at the Bradley Street Bike Cooperative, and am on the co-op's Volunteer Advisory Board and in the Values working group. I'm also a regular at MakeHaven, New Haven's incredible makerspace, where I am working on building an electric guitar. I am part of Mending Minyan, a local congregation of leftist, anti-Zionist, and radically inclusive Jews & friends of Jews. I can also be found regularly in the music scene, attending music concerts and other performances at local venues like Never Ending Books / Volume II.
